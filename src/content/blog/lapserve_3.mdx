## How photos will be managed

On the phone Iâ€™ll use an app called **[Photosync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home)** to upload the newly captured photos to a **WebDAV server** (Nextcloud) each time I connect to my home network (additionally I could set it up so that the upload would happen only at night and when the phone is in charge. Nice!)

These photos would sit in a folder on the HDD, waiting to be cleaned of **junk shots** and, whenever I feel like, organised between miscellaneous or experience albums and moved to my photo archive, which sits on the HDD as well.

Then **Photoprism** catches the new photos from the archive and displays them.

**Why Photoprism**: I evaluated several alternatives, including nextcloud Memories App. At the moment Photoprism seems the most well thought out platform, it has one task and it does it wonderfully! This may be due to the freemium nature of the product, but I feel to agree with their philosophy, which they have nicely [justified](https://www.photoprism.app/membership/faq) too, Kudos!
Something I appreciated is for example the attention devoted to the [management of RAW photos](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/media/raw/) and the detailed explanation of the result they achieved and how the compared to other options.
I believe such little things show the quality of thought they put in the project, so I choose them.
