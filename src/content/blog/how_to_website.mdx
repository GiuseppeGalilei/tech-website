## TLDR

This is a static website created with **Astro**, versioned and continuously integrated on **GitHub**, hosted and continuously deployed on **Netlify**.
Drafts are written in **Notion**, exported as **Markdown** and refined as **MarkdownX**.
Typeface is **Inter**, styling is done with **Tailwind**, the color palette is inspired by Dieter Rams’ era **Braun** products.

## Requirements

I needed:

- low running cost
- clean aesthetic
- simple code (I’m a newbie in web dev)
- easy maintenance

This process was inspired by three people I follow: [Maggie](https://maggieappleton.com/) for the ethos of the project, [Riccardo](https://riccardo.im/articoli/tutorial-sito-statico/) for the technical part and [Arun](https://arun.is) for the design.

## Tech

### Building

First of all, this is a **static** website, which means it is built almost entirely beforehand, so that the hosting will serve almost only html files with eventually some JavaScript., while the client will have little to do. 
This should make for a **fast** and **lean** website, with little to **no maintenance** needed.

There are several static website builders and frameworks, the best known are Gatsby and Hugo, I opted for **Astro**, a relative newcomer with several tricks up the sleeve. 

For styling I used **TailwindCSS**, I found it easy to use and very well documented.

### Deploy

Keeping this site online costs about **10 euros** per year, which corresponds to the cost of the domain. 
Hosting is free via **Netlify** as well as content delivery via **Cloudinary**.
Both services offer very generous free plans, more than enough for me at the moment.

### Where to start

I’m a newbie in web development, so I chose to start from an existing Astro template, tweak it and learn by trial and error. 

Exploring the [Astro Theme Gallery](https://astro.build/themes/) I found the [Nimbus Narrative](https://github.com/abdllahdev/nimbus-narratives) template, it had a clean aesthetic and interesting features, such as article series and table of contents, so I choose it.

The result you see today boasts several **changes** and **improvements** over the original version such as full responsive layout and fonts, and a new blog page layout.

### Tips to start at lightspeed

- Use VScode and install the following extensions
    - Markdown
    - TailwindCSS
    - Astro
- Understand Astro project structure
- Understand key Tailwind concepts
    - responsiveness
    - dark mode
    - flex and grid
    
    refer to the [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
    

## Design

The aim was to create a space that could be **cozy** as a **diary** yet **simple** and **practical**, as a good **tool**.

### Layout

The content sits in a column in the **center** of the page, whose **size** has been chosen to enhance **readability**.
This allows your head to stand still while only eye movement is required for reading, which makes it faster and easier.

The layout is **responsive** but remains **consistent** across mobile and desktop, to simplify development and keep a familiar feel.
When using larger screens the font size enlarges and some additional content is displayed, like the Table of Contents in the blog page.

The only aesthetic element are the outlined borders which, in my idea, manage to look nice while neatly separating sections.

### Colors

The website has a **dark** and a **light** version, you can switch between them with the button on the top right.

I kept the **background** simple, choosing two shades of **grey** very close to black and white, I did the same for the **text**.
This because it has been demonstrated that such combination of colors greatly enhances readability, also reducing eye strain.

**Accent colours** are something I still need to work on.
As of now, the inspiration came from the iconic Braun products designed by Dieter Rams: there, on top of plain background, a few colours popped out, each having a clear and intuitive meaning.

I chose **Teal Green** to indicate that by clicking on it a new page would open, be it internal site navigation or a link to other websites.

I chose **orange** to highlight important information, as of now just my name on the homepage and the home navigation button on the top left.

### Typography

I’ve played it safe by choosing the **Inter** typeface by Rasmus Andersson.
It is a wonderful project which aims to be the Helvetica of the digital world, by prioritizing readability on screens. 
The project has been very successful and even though it is quite new, you can already find it everywhere, even in NASA instrumentation.

After trying different weights I settled on 300 - Light.

### Details

- Compared to the original theme, the **blogpost page** has been completely **redesigned**, all the main content now sits in the central column, while a table of contents, when reading from desktop, appears on the right making use of the empty space.
Before, it would appear in the central column, ruining the cohesive aesthetic and hindering usability in case of a very long one.
- When using dark mode, a light **grey overlay** is placed on top of some images and iframes (especially bright white ones) to **blend** them better with the page.

## Daily usage

The website code lives in a **GitHub** repository, linked to **Netlify** for **CI/CD**.

When I feel like I start by writing articles on **Notion**, this gives me a nice interface, cloud backups and ease of use.

Once I’m fairly satisfied with the result, I open a new **branch** in the repository and paste the article content from Notion in a new `.mdx` **file**.
From here I can start to **refine** it for display in the website, for example MarkdownX gives me the option to add interactive elements.

Once I’m close to finish I open a **pull request**, Netlify automatically picks it up via GitHub actions and provides a **preview deployment** for testing.

Once I’m happy with the result, the **PR gets merged**, Netlify picks it up, builds and **deploys** the new main version.

## What’s next

- Upgrading from Astro v2 to Astro v4 and add animations.
- Think of a way to make the homepage less utilitarian.
- Learn to do illustrations.
