## Story time

Your phone is starting to fill up with pictures, you have to put them somewhere, there are some options:

- you can upload them on the cloud, but it can be pricey and compression ruins the quality.
- you can just transfer them to an hard drive using a usb cable, but nah, seems too simplistic and using a cable is a friction point I don’t want.
- you can setup a process for automatic backup when you come home, you are an engineer after all, right?

Well, challenge accepted! Oh, one more thing, given that it seems you’ll need some service running all the time anyway, maybe you can setup a whole server, right?!

### TLDR

I needed a way to backup photos from my phone, so I overdid it and built a fully fledged home server in the process.
