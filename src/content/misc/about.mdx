## $ whoami_
I’m **Giuseppe Galilei**, currently a master student in Data Science and Engineering at **Politecnico di Torino**, **Italy**.

## Why this website
Throughout my life, I've consistently explored ways to leverage technology for the **automation** and **enhancement** of our **daily lives**. It all began with experimenting, such as flashing **custom ROMs** on a Samsung Galaxy ACE, strategically placing **NFC tags**, particularly beneath my high school desk, to automatically activate "do not disturb" mode and avoid getting caught by the teacher. I even went so far as to outfit the entire house with professional-grade **Ubiquiti network** gear, simply because I found it intriguing.

As time progressed, my focus shifted to integrating **artificial intelligence** into various aspects of life, leading to my current studies.

This platform emerged from the desire to share the **projects** I've undertaken and will undertake, along with **ideas**, **reflections**, concise **code snippets**, and everyday discoveries.

The primary objective of this space is to contribute to the developer's **community**. Many of my endeavors would not have been feasible without the guidance and inspiration drawn from numerous personal blogs, Medium posts, or discussions on platforms like Reddit.

It's important to note that **this platform doesn't set out to provide formal instruction**. I am just a boy embarking on a career journey, continually learning and documenting my experiences. **Consider this an invitation to join me on my tech journey**!

## Fun facts about me
- Occasionally, I indulge in **specialty coffees** as a personal treat.
- On weekends I'm usually in the middle of nowhere, exploring new places with my **mountain bike**.
- I have a strong appreciation for well-crafted **design**, whether it's in the form of physical products or digital interfaces.
- I make it a goal to experience at least one **wow moment** each day.
