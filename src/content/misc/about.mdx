## $ whoami_
I’m **Giuseppe Galilei**, currently a master student in Data Science and Engineering at **Politecnico di Torino**, **Italy**.

## Why this website
My whole life I've been tinkering with ways to use tech to automate and improve our everyday life. It started with flashing new custom ROMs on a Samsung Galaxy ACE, attaching NFC tags everywhere, especially under my highschool desk, to automatically put the phone in "do not disturb" and not get caught by the teacher, or wiring the whole house with industry grade Ubiquiti network gear, because why not.
Later I started trying to put AI everywhere and here we are.

This place was born from the desire to share projects I did and I'll do, ideas, toughts, simple snippets and everyday findings.

This place tries to give back to the developer’s community. A lot of the things I do could have never been possible if it wasn’t for the advice and inspiration from countless personal blogs on the web, medium posts or reddit feuds.

Also, this place doesn’t aim to teach anything, I'm just a guy starting his career and learning along the way, who likes to share his notes.

Welcome to my journey in tech!

## Fun facts about me
- I sometimes like to treat myself with specialty coffes
- I do mountain biking
- I get crazy for good design, both product or digital

## How this website was made
I'm currently writing a post explaining all of it.
In the meantime you can find all the code [here](https://github.com/GiuseppeGalilei/tech-website/).
