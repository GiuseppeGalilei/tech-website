The system has been running reliably for some time now altough there are still some things that I need to better address, like an automated remote backup solution.

I hope you enjoyed this journey, for me it has been a nice way to tinker with old tech I hand lying around and reconnect with the self hosting community.

Most importantly, I truly needed a system for making memories easily accessible, something I find myself really enjoying once in a while.
